# Planet_Explorer V 1.0
My first project, it consists of a partially accurate array of planets. It has the sun and all eight planets
Controls are: Arrow keys for thrust, Left and right, no down button. the < , > , / buttons control timewarp. < is slow down timewarp, > is speed up timewarp, / is bring time warp to regular speed. the P key pauses the game. press it again to unpause. There are some other button on the bottom left of the screen. the planetary survey gives a random percentage of ore from the closest planet, Crew report gives the crew report, and Plant flag plants a flag (It cannot be seen on the planet Its a Just for fun thing.) Enjoy! Tell me if there are any Bugs in the code.
90% of coding is credited to dglittle, a amazing programmer.
